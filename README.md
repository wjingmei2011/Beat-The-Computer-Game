**Beat the Computer\!**

Welcome to the [**Beat the Computer\!**](https://frontend-img-amd.onrender.com/) web app‚Äîan interactive, fast-paced experience built with modern web technologies. Below is a friendly rundown of the tech stack behind the project, how everything works together, and why each component was chosen.

---

**üåüFeatures & Highlights**

* **Microservices Architecture**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) efficiently scale frontend and backend separately.  
* **Blazing Fast**: [Redis](https://redis.io/technology/data-structures/) caching keeps response times ultimately short.  
* **Secure by Design**: [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) ensures secure handling and lightweight hashing of user passwords.

---

**My Key Take-away:** 

while it‚Äôs super efficient to spin up a full stack‚Äîincluding a containerized database‚Äîusing Docker Compose during development, in production it‚Äôs much easier to separate the deployment. Using managed database services while containerizing other services works better for scalability and ease of maintenance, especially given the stateful nature of databases.

**Frontend**

Built using **React.js**, a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive UIs effortlessly.

**Key Tools:**

¬∑   	**React-Dom**: Essential for rendering React components to the DOM

* **React Router**: Seamless client-side navigation.  
* **Tailwind CSS**: Easy, responsive styling with minimal hassle.

---

   
**Backend**  
Powered by **Node.js** & **Express.js**, offering simplicity and high performance for API creation.

**Security:**

* **bcryptjs**: a popular NPM package that provides a C++-based implementation of the bcrypt algorithm. Encrypts passwords securely, ensuring user data stays protected. A good balance point between speed & security is when saltRounds \= 10\.  

**Database:**

* **PostgreSQL** hosted on **Amazon RDS:**  
  * Reliable, fully managed, and scalable database service (*more expensive than self-managed containerized database, but also less maintenance / easier scalability*).  
  * Simplified database management with automatic backups.  
  * Secure credentials management using *AWS Secrets Manager*.

**Caching & Session Management:**

* **Redis**: Instead of *MemoryStore*, provided by express-session and a basic in-memory store primarily intended for development and testing purposes, I chose Redis which efficiently handles real-time interactions, requests across multi-server instances, and can be easily deployed / connected on Render.  
  ¬∑   	**localStorage**: Utilized on the client side in conjunction with Redis and express-session, providing additional persistence and ensuring quick data access directly within the user's browser.

---

**üê≥ Containerization**

* **Docker** ensures consistent application behavior across development, testing, and production.  
* **Docker Compose** orchestrates frontend, backend, PostgreSQL, and Redis services seamlessly for effortless local development.

---

**Easy Deployment with Render**

Render is perfect for this application due to:

* Quick container deployments via **Docker Hub integration.**  
* Immediate free-tier access without complicated setups or surprise bills (like other cloud services).  
* Automatic HTTPS, scaling, and GitHub continuous deployments included.
